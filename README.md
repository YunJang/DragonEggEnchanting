# DragonEggEnchanting - 1.8.x

Current Version: 1.0.0

Written for our personal Minecraft server that is running Spigot 1.8.x. Spigot 1.8.1 API was used but it should work as long as Minecraft remains on version 1.8.

**The plugin is currently unavailable as it is still in progress.**

Description:
- Provide a better alternative to equipment enchantment upgrades by using Dragon Eggs and large number of levels to give your players a chance to upgrade their equipment beyond vanilla's max enchantment levels! This is more suitable for servers that have respawning Ender Dragons -- giving it a semi-RPG aspect to the feature without completely breaking balance in the game.

Features:
- Enhance your equipment past the default enchantment levels (such as Efficiency V) by using a Dragon Egg and large number of levels (default is 50).
- The higher the level of your current enchantment, the lower the chance of success!
	- Rates are still being thought out.
- Following Enchantments are obtainable:
	- Power X
	- Sharpness X
	- Bane of Arthopods X
	- Smite X
	- Efficiency X
	- Unbreaking X
	- Fortune X
	- Looting X
	- Luck of the Sea X
	- Lure VIII (otherwise, the fishing rod fails to fish)
	- Protection X
	- Blast Protection X
	- Feather Falling X
	- Fire Protection X
	- Projectile Protection X
	- Thorns X
